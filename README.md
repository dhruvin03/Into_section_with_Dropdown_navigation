## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

By doing this challenged I learnt the following things:

1. How the responsive websites work.

2. How the flexbox, positions and media queries work. 

3. How to use javascript to make dropdowns active and inactive.

### Continued development

As this was my first fronend mentor challenge i used pure HTMl, CSS and JS. From here on will look to use frameworks like React or Javascript. Also will work on how to achieve mobile first approach.
